                <h3>Here's Mr. Gurdjieff Biography:</h3>
                <h5>Early years:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gurdjieff is beleived to be born in 1877 in Alexandropol</li>
                    <li>He spent his childhood in Kars. Growing up in a multi-ethnic society, Gurdjieff became fluent in 
                    Armenian, Pontic Greek, Russian and Turkish, speaking the last in a mixture of elegant Osmanlı 
                    and some dialect</li>
                    <li>The young Gurdjieff avidly read Russian-language scientific literature. Influenced by these writings, 
                    and having witnessed a number of phenomena that he could not explain, he formed the conviction that 
                    there existed a hidden truth not to be found in science or in mainstream religion</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Travels:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In early adulthood, according to his own account, Gurdjieff's curiosity led him to travel to 
                    Central Asia, Egypt, Iran, India, Tibet and Rome</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>In Russia:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>On New Year's Day in 1912, Gurdjieff arrived in Moscow and attracted his first students. In the same year, he married the Polish Julia Ostrowska in Saint Petersburg</li>
                    <li>In 1916 he had about 30 pupils, among them P.D. Ouspensky who already had a reputation as a writer on mystical subjects and the composer Thomas de Hartmann with his wife Olg</li>
                    <li>The Fourth Way "system" taught during this period was complex and metaphysical, partly expressed in scientific terminology</li>
                    <li>In the midst of revolutionary upheaval in Russia, Gurdjieff left Petrograd in 1917 to return to his family home in Alexandropol. During the Bolshevik Revolution, he set up temporary study communities in Essentuki in the Caucasus, then in Tuapse, Maikop, Sochi and Poti, all on the Black Sea coast of southern Russia, where he worked intensively with many of his Russian pupils</li>
                    <li>In March 1918, Ouspensky separated from Gurdjieff, settling in England and teaching the Fourth Way in his own right</li>
                    <li>In spring 1919, Gurdjieff met the artist Alexandre de Salzmann and his wife Jeanne and accepted them as pupils. Assisted by Jeanne de Salzmann, Gurdjieff gave the first public demonstration of his Sacred Dances (Movements at the Tbilisi Opera House, 22 June)</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>In Georgia and Turkey:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 1919, Gurdjieff and his closest pupils moved to Tbilisi. There, Gurdjieff's wife Julia Ostrowska, the Stjoernvals, the Hartmanns, and the de Salzmanns gathered the fundamentals of his teaching</li>
                    <li>In the same year Gurdjieff established his first Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man</li>
                    <li>In late May 1920, when political conditions in Georgia changed and the old order was crumbling, his party travelled to Batumi on the Black Sea coast and then travelled by ship to Istanbul</li>
                    <li>In Istanbul, Gurdjieff met his future pupil Capt. John G. Bennett, then head of British Military Intelligence in Constantinople</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Prieuré at Avon:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In August 1921 and 1922, Gurdjieff travelled around western Europe, lecturing and giving demonstrations of his work in various cities, such as Berlin and London</li>
                    <li>After an unsuccessful attempt to gain British citizenship, Gurdjieff established the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man south of Paris at the Prieuré des Basses Loges in Avon near the famous Château de Fontainebleau</li>
                    <li>Older pupils noticed how the Prieuré teaching differed from the complex metaphysical "system" that had been taught in Russia. Gurdjieff was putting into practice his teaching that people need to develop physically, emotionally and intellectually, hence the mixture of lectures, music, dance, and manual work</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>First car accident, writing and visits to North America:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starting in 1924, Gurdjieff made visits to North America, where he eventually received the pupils taught previously by A.R. Orage</li>
                    <li>In 1924, while driving alone from Paris to Fontainebleau, he had a near-fatal car accident. Nursed by his wife and mother, he made a slow and painful recovery against medical expectation</li>
                    <li>After recovering, he began writing Beelzebub's Tales, the first part of All and Everything in a mixture of Armenian and Russian</li>
                    <li>The book was deliberately convoluted and obscure, forcing the reader to "work" to find its meaning. He also composed it according to his own principles, writing in noisy cafes to force a greater effort of concentration</li>
                    <li>Gurdjieff was in New York from November 1925 to the spring of 1926, when he succeeded in raising over $100,000. He was to make six or seven trips to the US, where he alienated a number of people with his brash and impudent demands for money</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>The Rope:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Despite his fund-raising efforts in America, the Prieuré operation ran into debt and was shut down in 1932. Gurdjieff constituted a new teaching group in Paris. Known as The Rope, it was composed of only women</li>
                    <li>In 1935, Gurdjieff stopped work on All and Everything. He had completed the first two parts of the planned trilogy but only started on the Third Series. (It was later published under the title Life Is Real Only Then, When 'I Am'.)</li>
                    <li>In 1936, he settled in a flat at 6, Rue des Colonels-Renard in Paris, where he was to stay for the rest of his life. In 1937, his brother Dmitry died, and The Rope disbanded</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Wold War II:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Although the flat at 6 Rue des Colonels-Renard was very small for the purpose, he continued to teach groups of pupils throughout World War II</li>
                    <li>His teaching was now far removed from the original "system", being based on proverbs, jokes and personal interaction, although pupils were required to read, three times if possible, copies of his magnum opus Beelzebub's Tales</li>
                    <li>His personal business enterprises (he had intermittently been a dealer in oriental rugs and carpets for much of his life, among other activities) enabled him to offer charitable relief to neighbours who had been affected by the difficult circumstances of the war, and it also brought him to the attention of the authorities, leading to a night in the cells</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Final Years:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the war, Gurdjieff tried to reconnect with his former pupils. Ouspensky was reluctant, but after his death (October 1947), his widow advised his remaining pupils to see Gurdjieff in Paris</li>
                    <li>Gurdjieff suffered a second car accident in 1948 but again made an unexpected recovery</li>
                    <li>After recovering, Gurdjieff finalised plans for the official publication of Beelzebub's Tales and made two trips to New York. He also visited the famous prehistoric cave paintings at Lascaux, giving his interpretation of their significance to his pupils</li>
                    <li>Gurdjieff died at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. His funeral took place at the St. Alexandre Nevsky Russian Orthodox Cathedral at 12 Rue Daru, Paris. He is buried in the cemetery at Avon (near Fontainebleau)</li>
                </ul>
